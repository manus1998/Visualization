# Visualization

This work presents seven different interactive graphs about F1 between the years 2016 and 2022, created using Python libraries such as pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The purpose of this work is to display interactive graphics. 


The data for this project was obtained from Kaggle, provided by an F1 enthusiast who created datasets by year, circuit, and qualification. The datasets from 2016 to 2022, specifically circuit results, were used. All datasets were modified into a single one, and time columns were adjusted to indicate whether the driver finished the race. The original datasets can be accessed via the following link:
